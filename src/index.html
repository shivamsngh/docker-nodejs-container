        <p>The next talk is “Designing a Multilingual Virtual Agent for interacting with Uneducated People” Collecting data,
            for surveying, from people among low income groups, has been done using pen-and-paper, by field agents. This
            activity is difficult when the audience is uneducated. We propose an AI based solution that uses speech recognition
            and text-to-speech techniques to power an interactive virtual agent that can speak and understand the local language
            to assist an uneducated person in filling up a survey.</p>
